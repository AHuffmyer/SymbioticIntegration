# Study overview   

This repository contains data and scripts for an experiment testing the effects of temperature on coral-symbiont nutritional exchange in *Montipora capitata* larvae from summer 2021 in Hawaii.  

In this study, we exposed larvae of *M. capitata* to 3 days of +2.5Â°C temperatures above ambient. We collected data on larval survival, settlement, physiology, and metabolic response to temperature treatments.

In this study, we used stable isotope 13C carbon tracing metabolomics to understand metabolic responses to temperature treatment and track symbiotic nutritional exchange. An overview of these data types can be viewed below.
