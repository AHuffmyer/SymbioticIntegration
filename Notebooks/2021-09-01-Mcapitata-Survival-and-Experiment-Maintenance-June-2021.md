Post detailing survival measurements and experimental maintenance in larval temperature experiment with M. capitata in June 2021.  

# Larval Survival

Survival measurements were conducted every 12 hours to monitor larval densities and ensure enough larvae were available for final sampling. Measured by mixing larvae in conical and taking n=6 25mL samples per conical. Larvae were then counted in each sample and returned to conical, providing a measurement of larval density at each time point (larvae per ml). 

6/15/2021 - larval survival measured at 0830-1000 and 2200-2330. 

6/16/2021 - larval survival measured at 0900 and 2100. 

6/17/2021 - larval survival measured at 0830 and 2130. On this day I noticed a decrease in density in about 3 conicals of each temperature. Larvae may have been leaking through the conicals. Will start sampling on 6/18/2021 to avoid more larval loss, and allows for 3 full days of temperature exposure. 

# Experiment Maintenance

Measured physical conditions daily and recorded in Google drive. 

Calibrated apex probes to digital thermometer prior to temperature start and on 6/15/2021. High tank probe was reading high, so first day was lower than target, providing a "ramp" day. 

Continuing to check and clean cultures regularly every 2-3 hours from 6/15-6/18.
