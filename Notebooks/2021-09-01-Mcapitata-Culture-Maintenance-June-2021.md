Post detailing culture maintenance of embryos of *Montipora capitata* during June 2021 larval temperature experiment and spawning.  

# Activities 

6/12/2021

* Cultures were stable overnight with minimal mortality at 0800 with developing embryos. 

* All conicals and buckets were at ambient temperature under shade cloth. Flow increased to 30mL per 10 sec in conicals. Buckett had bubblers rotating every 3-4 hours. 

* Light, PAR, temperature, salinity measurements taken at 1315 recorded on Google Drive data collection sheet. 

* Water was changed in all buckets at 1100-1200. 

* Cultures look stable and clean! 

6/13/2021

* Measured light, pH, temp at 1530 

* A. Williams and L. Allen-Waller helped maintain cultures throughout the experiment and monitoring water level in headers/coolers. 

* Swimming behavior seen at 2000, ~72 hours post fertilization in samples from previous day's spawning from H. Putnam larvae

* Cleaned, drained all conicals and buckets and pooled all together in preparation for baseline sampling and temperature treatments.
