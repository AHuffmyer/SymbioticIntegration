Post detailing stable isotope time series data collection for methods optimization and development for coral larvae in collaboration with Rutgers University. 

# Activities 

Started C13 incubations for a 24 hour time series in order to optimize future incubations with larvae and determine detetion limits in a time series. 

Incubations performed on larval pool from extra larvae from buckets at ambient temperature. 

Isotope preparation and sampling of larvae conducted as described for 6/18/2021 larval sampling. 

n=2 vials for the following time points on 6/22: 

* Start at 0945: no samples collected
* 1 hour @ 1045: n=2 vials sampled
* 3 hours @ 1245: n=2 vials sampled
* 6 hours @ 1545: n=2 vials sampled
* 12 hours @ 2145: n=2 vials sampled
* 24 hours @0945 on 6/23: n=2 vials sampled

1-1.5mL larvae added in each vial. Light at 900PAR and temperature at 28C. Stored at -80C after flash freezing.
