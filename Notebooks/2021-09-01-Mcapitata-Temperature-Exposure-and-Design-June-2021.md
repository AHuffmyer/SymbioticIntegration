Post detailing temperature exposure and experimental design for M. capitata larval temperature experiment in June 2021. 

# Larval and Tank Set Up

Larval pool of developed larvae was divided into even alloquots - 75% of larvae were allocated into conicals for temperature treatment and 25% of larvae were allocated back into buckets for extra material and samples. In total, we had n=12 conicals (6 per temp) and n=4 buckets at ambient temperature with densities of ~0.8-1.2 larvae per mL, close to target of 1 larva per mL optimal density. 

All added to final containers at 2130 on 6/14/2021, temperature treatments will start 6/15/2021. 

Cleaned all coolers, conicals, and tanks. 

# Temperature Treatments and Conditions 

Programmed Apex temperatures in preparation for experiment starting on 6/15/2021. 

Apex Neptune Aquacontroller system programmed to respond to probe in a conical on high temperature treatment. Probe in ambient tank for monitoring only. No temprature control to ambient tanks. 

Ambient natural profile over the last week: 26.2C - 27.5C. Programmed a diel cycle to reflect degree of variation in ambient temperature profile. 

High temperature profile will range from 28.8C to 30.1C daily. This reflects a profile ~2-3C above ambient temperatures. 

Apex controlled 2 heaters in cooler/header tank and 2 heaters in the water bath with a recirculating pump in each. During the heat of the day all heaters had to be on to reach maximum temperature, so system had to be closely monitored for electrical overloading. 

6/15/2021

Temperature treatments were turned "on" at 0800 and reached the target temperature by 1100.
