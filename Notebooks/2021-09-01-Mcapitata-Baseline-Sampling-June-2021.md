Post detailing sampling of Mcapitata larvae collected as baseline samples prior to temperature experiment in June 2021. 

# Overview

Baseline samples collected from larval pool prior to temperature exposure from June 2021 M. capitata spawning event.  

# Sampling  

On 6/14/2021, all larval conicals were pooled and mixed prior to collection of samples as baseline measurements for future sampling. 

The following samples were collected by pipetting (P1000) concentrated larvae (floating at surface in small container): 

* "M" (molecular): n=4 samples, 200 uL of larvae, flash frozen, stored at -80C at 1905
* "E" (energetics): n=12 samples to allow for n=4 for three assays (carbs, lipids, proteins), 200 uL of larvae, flash frozen, stored at -80C at 1830
* "P" (physiology): n=4 samples, 100 uL larvae, 4% PFA fixation, stored at 4C at 1840
* "C" (chlorophyll): n=4 samples, 200 uL of larvae, flash frozen, stored at -80C at 1645
* "S" (shield): n=4 samples, 200 uL larvae, 400 uL RNA DNA shield, stored at 4C at 1915
